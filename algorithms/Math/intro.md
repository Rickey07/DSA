# Introduction to Math Algorithms in JavaScript

Math algorithms form the basis for solving a wide range of computational problems. In JavaScript, mathematical operations can be easily implemented using built-in operators, functions, and libraries. These algorithms are used to perform basic arithmetic, complex calculations, and solve various real-world problems such as optimization, geometry, and number theory.

## What is a Math Algorithm?

A math algorithm is a step-by-step process or a set of instructions designed to perform calculations, process numerical data, or solve a mathematical problem. They range from basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication to more complex algorithms like prime number checks or greatest common divisor (GCD) calculations.

### Basic Arithmetic in JavaScript

JavaScript provides built-in support for basic arithmetic operations:

```javascript
const a = 10;
const b = 5;

// Addition
console.log(a + b); // Output: 15

// Subtraction
console.log(a - b); // Output: 5

// Multiplication
console.log(a * b); // Output: 50

// Division
console.log(a / b); // Output: 2
